## Definition of "good enough" for this project

What would the team collectively consider "good enough" of an achievement for the project?
(One response for the whole team)

We aim for a grade of at least 90%. "Good enough" means the application is fully functional without crashing and meets all the core requirements: creating/editing decks, running a study session, and accurately saving/loading data. We agree that a stable, clean application submitted on time is better than a feature-rich app that is buggy or late.

## Picked Topic

- **Topic 2: Flashcard Study App (Learning / Study)**

---

## Division of Work

How will each member contribute to the project?

### Member A (Backend and Logic Focus)

- **Models and Repos:** Creating the `Deck` and `Card` classes.
- **Data Persistence:** Implementing the Save/Load logic to ensure decks and cards are persisted to text/CSV files.
- **Quiz Logic:** Writing the algorithms for shuffling cards in Quiz Mode and calculating the final percentage score.

### Member B (Frontend and UI Focus)

- **Views and Navigation:** Designing the windows using WPF.
- **Interactivity:** Handling UI events (for example, flipping the card from Front to Back, marking cards as "Got it" or "Missed").
- **Documentation:** Compiling the final report, formatting the user guide, and ensuring the UI meets the "Appearance" requirements.

## Frequency of Communication

How often will the team be in touch and what tools will be used to communicate?

- We will communicate daily via Discord for quick updates and file sharing.

---

## Response Delays

What is a reasonable delay to reply to messages? Is it the same for weekdays and weekends?

- **Weekdays:** We expect a reply within 4 to 6 hours.
- **Weekends:** We expect a reply within 12 hours.

If a member is unable to work on the project for a specific day, they must notify the other member in advance.

---

## Receiving Feedback

Each member must provide a sample sentence for how they would like to receive constructive feedback from their peers.

- **Member A:**
  "I prefer direct, technical feedback. For example: 'The load function is throwing an error on empty lines; can you look at the loop condition again?'"

- **Member B:**
  "I prefer feedback that suggests improvements rather than just pointing out errors. For example: 'The study screen looks good, but maybe we can increase the font size on the cards to make them more readable?'"

---

## In Case of Conflict

If a team member fails to communicate as described in this contract or does not respond to constructive feedback, what measures should the other teammate take?
(One response for the whole team)

1. **Direct Reminder:** Send a message via Discord tagging the member, restating the pending task and the deadline.
   
2. **Call:** If there is no response within 24 hours, attempt a direct voice/video call.
   
3. **Professor Mediation:** If communication breaks down for more than 48 hours or if a critical deadline is at risk, we will contact the professor for guidance.
